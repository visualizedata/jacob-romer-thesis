Designing Graphic Interpretation

Interpretation
	- textual: close reading
	– visual / graphical: critical literacy, compositional

Diagrammatic writing emerges – we need to specify its critical properties

In spite of the networked condition of textual production, the design for digital platforms for daily use has hardly begun to accomodate the imaginative possibilities of constellationary composition, graphic interpretation, and diagrammatic writing.

The conventions and capacities of screen display and format features, the computationally enabled processes of analysis, and the flexibility of configuring relations and boundaries at different scales allow us to write differently and familiarly using digital media.

Integrating the computational possibilities of social media, live feed, linked and hyperlinked references and resources, data minig, and so on, makes us see the relations among units and lines of argument in diagrammatic modes.

The contingent character of any act of textual production increases exponentially with the expansion of data on which it draws for its composition and display. The conditional text has become the norm.

Authorship

– fluid texts of Homer
– authors of the Bible
- historical Shakespeare

examples of a common condition

The author, proclaimed dead by post-structuralists, may become the anomaly.

Innovations

To Dos:

show uncertainty and ambiguity in digital models
modeling diversity
expose differences in ontologies as ideology

–––

Will we think differently because of the ways interpretation takes shape across networked contingencies?

Qs

– A return to our once-sensible reading of naturla and cultural landscapes?
– Why do we always seem to fall back on linear textual narrative?
– What if man is a storytelling animal and there's no way graphesis can have the same cognitive efficacy?
